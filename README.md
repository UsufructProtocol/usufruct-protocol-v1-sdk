# Usufruct Protocol — SDK

## Prototype status (`prototype/vertical-slice`)

A vertical slice of the SPEC.md design is implemented and validated **live
against testnet v1.4.2** (`npm run e2e` → ALL PASS, 25 offline tests green):

- **Codegen substrate** (`npm run codegen`, `@mysten/codegen` from the local
  Move source; regenerable, committed under `src/codegen/`).
- **Four primitives** (`src/primitives/`): `EscrowState` + `decodeEscrowState`,
  `View<T>`, `Origin/Transition/Terminal` actions, `Source` + `chainSource`.
- **Views**: 14 Pattern B exemplars (predicates, identity, temporal,
  `CurveShape` enum collapse §5.1) + 2 Pattern A `simulateTransaction` reads.
- **Actions**: `integrate`, `rent`, `applyPendingTransitionStates`, `retire`,
  `claimAsset` — `toPtb` complete; `apply.step` and `integrate.step` are real
  and **bit-exact against the live chain** (§8 invariant observed on testnet).
- **Golden gate**: `fixtures/testnet-escrow-1.json` is chain-captured;
  `test/golden.test.ts` replays it offline in CI.

Run the e2e (spends only gas from the signer):

```bash
SUI_PRIVATE_KEY=suiprivkey… npm run e2e   # or: sui keytool export fallback
```

### Scalability findings (prototype assessment)

1. **Codegen coverage — confirmed.** All 43 modules generate; generic
   `Escrow/AssetState/PolicyEnsemble` schemas decode the live object. The
   runtime package id threads cleanly through every wrapper's `package`
   option. Note: generation writes `package_summaries/` inside the Move
   package directory (gitignore it in the protocol repo).
2. **Enum collapse — confirmed.** BCS enums parse as `$kind` discriminated
   unions; the 9-view `credit_shape_*` family collapsed into ~30 lines.
3. **Marginal view cost — confirmed.** ~12 lines/view including docs; the
   remaining ~110 views are mechanical.
4. **Marginal `toPtb` cost — confirmed.** 5–20 lines/action; `&Clock`/`&Random`
   are auto-injected by the generated layer (SPEC §4.3 holds for free).
5. **`step` feasibility — confirmed** for deterministic configs:
   `apply.step` predicted the post-transition on-chain state bit-exactly on
   the first try (tenure expiry → descent → idle chain). Handover settlement
   (curve math) correctly refuses to ship without golden coverage.
6. **Asset-generic `A` — partially refuted.** The `Uint8Array` fallback of
   SPEC §10 is impossible: the asset sits mid-struct, so decoding *requires*
   the exact schema, and a wrong schema misaligns silently (observed live
   with `DummyAsset { id, uses }`). Proposed mitigation: re-serialize the
   decoded value and byte-compare as a decode invariant.
7. **Kernel stress — none.** No 5th primitive, no methods on state, no
   ambient time. Pattern A reads live as IO functions outside `View<T>`
   (`src/views/inspect.ts`) — SPEC should name this category explicitly.
   Time-as-parameter paid off: a ~15s local clock skew was harmless for
   views (same `t` both sides) and only mattered for *waiting* on chain
   boundaries (harness concern, solved by reading the `0x6` clock).
8. **Drift detection — not yet exercised** (edit a Move signature → regen →
   compile error placement). Follow-up.

Chain-observed behaviors worth remembering: `accrued_credit_mist` aborts on a
non-rented escrow; `BasisPoints` has no public constructor (pass pure `u64`,
BCS-identical); fixture parity must capture bytes and view answers at the same
object version.

# Usufruct Protocol — SDK Design Notes

> This document captures the architectural philosophy behind the SDK before its
> implementation begins. Read it before writing a single line of TypeScript.

---

## The governing insight

The protocol is the only implementation of the domain. The SDK is not.

This is a deliberate architectural choice with a precise meaning: every question
about protocol state — "can this user bid?", "what is the current floor price?",
"is the asset being retired?" — has exactly one authoritative answer, and that
answer lives in the on-chain Move code, verified by the Move compiler at deploy
time. The SDK does not reimplement those answers. It projects them.

The consequence is that there is no intermediate state with its own semantics.
The chain is the truth. The SDK is a lens.

---

## What this means in practice

### No `switch` on variant strings

Move enums have named variants. When you read a Sui object from the RPC, those
variants arrive as plain strings. The naive SDK pattern is to switch on them:

```typescript
// What you must never do
switch (escrow.fields.lifecycle_state.variant) {
  case "HandoverOpen":   return canBid(...)
  case "HandoverConfirmed": return ...
  default: return false
}
```

This is wrong for three reasons:

1. **Variant names are implementation details**, not the protocol's public API.
   A rename on the Move side breaks all TypeScript silently.

2. **Composed conditions cannot be expressed as a single variant.** `is_rented`
   is true in multiple variants. `is_retiring` is a cross-field condition with no
   variant of its own. A switch gets both wrong.

3. **You are now maintaining a second implementation of the domain in
   TypeScript.** That implementation can diverge. It can have bugs the protocol
   does not have. It must be kept in sync forever.

The protocol exposes boolean predicates precisely to eliminate this pattern:

```typescript
// What the SDK does
const state = {
  canBid:          is_handover_open(escrow) && viewer !== current_tenant_addr(escrow),
  showCountdown:   is_handover_open(escrow) && !is_handover_instant(escrow),
  showRetireAlert: is_retiring(escrow),
  isRented:        is_rented(escrow),
}
```

The frontend reads booleans. It has no opinion about which variants exist.

### No domain logic in the SDK

The SDK has exactly one job: serialize arguments, call the RPC, deserialize the
result. Any time you find yourself writing business logic in TypeScript — "if the
stake is greater than the floor then..." — stop. That logic belongs in the
protocol. If it is not already there, add it as a view function.

The test is simple: if the logic you are writing could have a bug that the Move
type checker would have caught, it is in the wrong place.

### No discrepancy possible

In a system with intermediate state — backend cache, SDK transformation layer,
frontend store — a bug can live in any layer and be internally consistent in all
of them. Debugging means finding which layer has the stale copy.

Here, the chain is the only copy. A bug can only be:

1. A bug in the protocol — caught by the Move compiler or the test suite before
   deploy.
2. A bug in the projection — the SDK asks the wrong question, or the UI renders
   the wrong answer.

The second type is trivial to locate. If `is_rented` returns `true` and the
borrow button is absent, the bug is in the render. There is nowhere else to look.

---

## The three layers

### Layer 1 — Auto-generated bindings

Generated by `@mysten/codegen` from the compiled Move ABI. Covers every public
function, every event type, every PTB call builder. Never written by hand. When
the protocol evolves, regenerate.

### Layer 2 — Semantic SDK

A thin hand-crafted layer that speaks in product terms, not Move terms.

```typescript
// Collects all predicate calls into a single devInspect round-trip
const renderState = await escrow.fetchRenderState(escrowId, viewerAddress)
// → { canBid, canBorrow, showCountdown, isRetiring, currentFloor, ... }

// Price simulation — uses _at_ms variants internally; Clock is irrelevant
const curve = await escrow.simulatePriceCurve(escrowId, {
  from: Date.now(),
  to:   Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 3600 * 1000,
  steps: 48,
})
// → Array<{ timestamp_ms: number, floor_price: bigint }>

// Fee breakdown — exposes compute_handover_settlement arithmetic as plain numbers
const settlement = await escrow.previewHandoverSettlement(escrowId, boundaryMs)
// → { remain_credit: bigint, owner_share: bigint, protocol_fee: bigint }

// Full audit trail from events — star schema on escrow_id, no joins needed
const history = await escrow.fetchTimeline(escrowId)
// → { rentals, bids, borrows, earnings }

// Typed real-time subscriptions
escrow.subscribe(escrowId, {
  onBidPlaced:     (e) => ...,
  onBidSuperseded: (e) => ...,
  onHandover:      (e) => ...,
  onTenureExpired: (e) => ...,
})
```

This layer has no domain logic. It groups predicate calls into ergonomic
round-trips and translates Move types to TypeScript primitives.

### Layer 3 — React hooks

A direct mechanical consequence of Layer 2. The hooks manage React Query
lifecycle; the domain logic stays in Move.

```typescript
function useEscrowState(escrowId: string, viewer: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["escrow", escrowId, viewer],
    queryFn:  () => escrow.fetchRenderState(escrowId, viewer),
    // refetch on new events via subscription
  })
}

function usePriceCurve(escrowId: string, window: { hours: number }) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["curve", escrowId, window.hours],
    queryFn:  () => escrow.simulatePriceCurve(escrowId, {
      from:  Date.now(),
      to:    Date.now() + window.hours * 3600 * 1000,
      steps: window.hours * 2,
    }),
  })
}
```

A component that uses these hooks has zero knowledge of Move internals:

```tsx
function RentalCard({ escrowId, viewer }: Props) {
  const { data: state } = useEscrowState(escrowId, viewer)
  const { data: curve } = usePriceCurve(escrowId, { hours: 48 })

  return (
    <Card>
      <PriceChart data={curve} />
      {state?.canBid      && <BidButton escrowId={escrowId} floor={state.currentFloor} />}
      {state?.showCountdown && <Countdown expiresAt={state.handoverExpiry} />}
      {state?.isRetiring  && <RetireAlert />}
    </Card>
  )
}
```

---

## Events: the star schema

Every protocol event carries `escrow_id` as its root foreign key. Every event is
self-describing — it contains all the fields needed to interpret it without
joining against any other event.

This means the full history of an escrow is reconstructable from events alone,
with a single query indexed on `escrow_id`. No secondary lookups. No state
reconstruction.

Events are immutable fact rows, not signals. A `HandoverCompleted` event does not
say "something changed, go fetch the new state." It says "a handover happened,
the displaced tenant was X, used credit was Y, protocol fee was Z, owner share
was W." The event is the record.

The SDK builds its `fetchTimeline` entirely from this event stream.

---

## Price simulation

The protocol exposes `_at_ms` variants of every price computation:

- `compute_floor_price_at_ms(escrow, timestamp_ms)`
- `compute_used_credit_at_ms(escrow, timestamp_ms)`

These exist because `devInspect` cannot override the `Clock` object — it always
reads the real network time. Functions that take `&Clock` can only answer "what
is the price right now." Functions that take `u64` can answer "what would the
price be at any point in time."

This transforms `devInspect` into a financial simulation engine. A UI can render
a full price curve for the next N hours with no backend, no off-chain math, and
no possibility of getting a different answer than the contract would compute.

---

## Settlement preview

`RefundState` is a hot-potato type — it has no abilities and cannot be returned
from a view function. Rather than forcing the SDK to reimplement the fee
arithmetic, the protocol exposes:

```
compute_handover_settlement(escrow, boundary_ms) → (remain_credit, owner_share, protocol_fee)
compute_tenure_settlement(escrow, expiry_ms)     → (owner_share, protocol_fee)
```

These return plain `u64` tuples. The SDK can show a complete fee breakdown before
any transaction is submitted. The math is the same math the contract will execute.

---

## What can be built

The examples below exist to demonstrate the SDK to third-party developers. They
are ordered by integration complexity.

### Rental Explorer
A live list of all active escrows with state, current floor price, and tenant.
Demonstrates `fetchRenderState` and event subscriptions updating in real time.
One page. No backend.

### Price Simulator
An interactive chart showing how the floor price of a specific asset evolves over
the next 48–168 hours. Built entirely from `simulatePriceCurve`. The user moves a
slider; the chart updates. Demonstrates that `devInspect` + `_at_ms` is a
complete simulation engine.

### Tenant Dashboard
All active rentals for an address — each with time remaining, current price,
pending bids, and a return action. Demonstrates `useEscrowState` and the
`subscribe` API for real-time updates on bid events.

### Owner Dashboard
Earnings per escrow, historical tenant list, withdraw flow. Built from
`EarningsWithdrawn` events and the `owner_balance` view. Demonstrates the event
timeline and the settlement preview before submitting a claim.

### Bid Monitor
Push notifications when a bid on any watched escrow is superseded. Subscribes to
`BidSuperseded` filtered by `displaced_bidder == myAddress`. The event carries
all necessary information — no fetch needed to compose the notification.

### Embeddable Rental Widget
A self-contained `<RentalWidget escrowId="0x...">` component that any NFT
marketplace can drop into an asset page. The protocol appears where the asset
lives. Demonstrates that the SDK is portable by design — no tight coupling to any
specific frontend.

### Protocol Analytics
Historical revenue, tenant retention rate, price distribution, most-active
assets. Built entirely from the event stream. Demonstrates that the star schema
is sufficient for serious analytics without any on-chain state reads.

---

## The guarantee to third-party developers

When the protocol says the state is X, the state is X.

There is no subgraph that might be one block behind. There is no SDK
transformation that might apply stale logic. There is no intermediate model that
has to be kept in sync with the contract. The SDK calls the protocol, the
protocol answers, the UI renders the answer.

For a developer who has spent time debugging discrepancies between an EVM SDK and
its contract — where the SDK computed a permission correctly given its cached
state, but that state had diverged three steps earlier — this is the argument
that converts.

The absence of intermediate state is not a simplification. It is a correctness
property.
